# TICK-TACK-TOE-FROM-BROKE-STUDENT
The best Tick Tack Toe game a broke student can make (Without knowledge on visual libraries)

## Features
Well... You can play Tick Tack Toe. Also, there are modes to play against the cpu or against a friend.

## Running
- Windows: Just download the .exe file in the latest release
- Linux: Download the latest .appimage release (Recommended over pure linux release) and go to that folder\
         Try and run it with: "./TicTacToe*"\,
         If it can't find FUSE, check [here](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE#install-fuse)

  

## Compiling
Clone and 'make' on terminal\n
- "make" and "make linux": Compiles linux executable
- "make appimage": Compiles whole Appimage for linux
- "make win": Compiles for windows
- "make clean": Deletes all the files from compiling, except executables (Run it between compilations)

## Special Thanks to...
My mom, who told me this is the best game ever :D
