# TICK-TACK-TOE-FROM-BROKE-STUDENT
The best Tick Tack Toe game a broke student can make (Without knowledge on visual libraries)

## Features
Well... You can play Tick Tack Toe. Also, there are modes to play against the cpu or against a friend.

      In terminal: "chmod +x TTT*"\
      Then run: "./TTT*"\
  Im learning AppImage to make other projects, but this is enought here i think. Anyways when i managed to make it work, im gonna add an AppImage to the release

Clone and 'make' on terminal, that should work on any system i think.
